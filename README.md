PictureSlider
=============

Simple screen saver. Shows randomly pictures from `~/Pictures`.

I wanted the possibility to fine-tune the existing Mac picture screen saver but as it is closed source, I recoded it.

The main differences so far:

* It skips some directories, e.g. any hidden ones and iPhoto/other caches.
* It only displays high-res (>1MB) pictures.
